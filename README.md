# Guard-of-City

Four weeks school project with three second year game designer students. This was my first time using Unreal Engine.
I was the only programmer on this project and I had as constraint to use C++, and only use Blueprints in last resort.
The code is working but it's not clean, I chose to use my free time on a new project [SurvivorSandboxUnreal](https://github.com/FelixPog/SurvivorSandboxUnreal).

## Game

The game is a base defense.
Player controls a third person character with a riffle gun and different capacities.
He must survive to enemy waves the longer he can.

Player features :

- Grenade launcher
- Fireball
- Grapple Hook
- Wind spell pushing enemy around the player
